This project will be a direct messaging app called "dms" that will allow people to text each other from different devices from far distances.
I will be using python and sockets to make this pitch possible. 
I will use different colors to make the appearance of the app appealing to the eye. 
In the chat, users will also be able to use emojis when texting.
